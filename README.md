# Thermostat Challenge

# Task 1:

* Thermostat starts at 20 degrees
* You can increase the temperature with an up function
* You can decrease the temperature with a down function
* The minimum temperature is 10 degrees
* If power saving mode is on, the maximum temperature is 25 degrees
* If power saving mode is off, the maximum temperature is 32 degrees
* Power saving mode is on by default but it can also be turned off
* You can reset the temperature to 20 with a reset function
* You can ask about the thermostat's current energy usage: < 18 is low-usage, <= 25 is medium-usage, anything else is high-usage.

# Next tasks:

* These involve creating an interface, then making this interact with the html code, so that you can have buttons on the thermostat that react to users clicking on the buttons.
  - For example the up button, is linked to the ```thermostat.up()``` function, this turns the temperature up one.
  - This is shown by the ```thermostat.temperature``` being displayed on the page also.
* Adding styles with css to the code. My current webpage is shown below, I added styles and animated buttons and search bars.
